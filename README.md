# dotfiles
My ~/.dotfiles directory. All hail dotfiles.

# Installation
Dotfiles specific to my `BASH` shell environment. You might find something
useful in here, but I highly doubt it.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kwakwaversal/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
```

Run the script to set up symlinks. It will only create a symlink if the file
doesn't currently exist.

```sh
sh ~/.dotfiles/install.sh
```
